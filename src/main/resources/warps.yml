# This is where all data will be stored for created warps.
# Go create some warps using the in-game command '/add-warp <warp-name>'!
# While it is not recommended, you can manually create warps using the following syntax:
#   <warp-name>:
#     # Location format is X, Y, Z, Yaw, Pitch
#     location: 0.5, 100.0, 0.5, 0.0, 90.0
