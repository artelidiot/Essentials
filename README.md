# Essentials

### Description
Essentials, as the name suggests, is another Essentials type of plugin.

It is, at its core, primarily trying to replicate [EssentialsX](https://github.com/EssentialsX/Essentials), that being said, I actually don't recommend that you use this.  I know, normally descriptions are trying to sell you on why you *should* use that particular piece of software...
Let me elaborate, I wrote this primarily to challenge myself with different styles of coding that I don't normally write in, the easiest and fastest way to do that, for me, is to replicate a known piece of software. 

It is 100% free and open source, and always will be. Any and all contributions and feedback are welcome.

### Included features
* Everything found in EssentialsX that is not listed in the [exclusions](#excluded-features)

### Excluded features
* An API
  * For now, I will not be building Essentials to use an API structure simply because I don't think it will ever need it.  This projects scope is not nearly large or sophisticated enough to need access like this.
    * That being said, if the project ever reaches a point where an API is requested; it won't be too hard to add - however, do not expect it to have the same level of compatibility with other plugins like EssentialsX has.
* The GeoIP module
  * I find this module to be rather invasive in terms of privacy; therefore I will not be writing or merging anything like it into this project.
* The Discord, XMPP or any similar external bridging modules
  * My primary reasoning for this is; I don't really care for these types of plugins and unfortunately, even if I did, no matter what I would end up writing would already be inferior software to what already exists out there.
